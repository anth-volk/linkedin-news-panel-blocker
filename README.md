# LinkedIn News Panel Blocker

This blocker removes LinkedIn's worst feature: the 'News' panel on the right side of the desktop app. The panel's filled with clickbait headlines whose sometimes inflammatory headlines can be distracting at best and baiting at worst.

But no more. This extension hides that panel, allowing you to focus on what matters: your own network.
